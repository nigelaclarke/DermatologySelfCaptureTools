# Medical Self Catpure Tools

The project aims to address the challenges faced by medical health care providers, such as dermatology or wound care, for patient self-submitted images. The project focuses on the initial patient onboarding and triage of incoming patients. The project aims to create a low-cost solution and implementation that can capture high-quality images of skin related health conditions for the patients, such that the patients can share clinically relevant images with doctors, thereby improving access to healthcare for patients in remote areas. Currently, many patient self-captured images are unsutabe for guiding healthcare decisions because they are out of focus, blurry, too close or too far, or have poor lighting. The project focused on providing a solution that allows patients to take clear and accurate images of their health conditions and share them with doctors and dermatologists remotely, such as many patients face when living in remote areas with limited access to healthcare services. 

# Project Background

This repository was created for the culmination of the Health{hacks} 2023 hackathon project. It was initially developped by Nigel [@nigelaclarke](https://github.com/nigelaclarke) and Michael [@mcleu](https://github.com/mcleu); where we received second place in the Population and Preventative Health track. More historical information, background, and biodesign inspiration process will be added at a later date.

# How it works

The project aims to provide low-cost, high-quality medical imaging solutions to underserved populations, starting with dermatology. The goal is to enable remote diagnosis and triage of skin conditions through the use of a imaging fiducial, as well as a mobile app or website that guides the patient through capturing high-quality images of the skin. 

The images captured by the user, as well as generic patient onboarding information, are transmitted to a cloud-based platform that would be accessible by the provider. It could be used in lieu of, or in conjunction with, the patient intake portion. Over time, it could use machine learning algorithms to analyze the images and provide a diagnosis. This project would enable the providers to prioritize urgent cases and route them to specialists for further evaluation. This project is designed to streamline the process of receiving medical care and reduce the need for in-person visits, which can be difficult or impossible for people living in remote areas.
